# -Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Homeworks
A compilation of all the coding assignments taken with Dr. Schweller.
# A brief overview
Dr. Schweller is notoriously known for giving challenging assignments
every week except for exam weeks. Most assignments took at least 12 hours 
to finish. I built lasting friendships with my classmates that took him 
and to this day we still communicate and even hang out. While most dropped 
his class as the weeks went by we stuck together and pulled multiple all-nighters
on campus to finish his assignments. Even though Dr. Schweller was a hard grader 
and a work-heavy professor, his lectures were outstanding and very interactive. I 
could listen to him teach for hours without breaking focus. In the end, he helped me
have a firm grasp on algorithms and data structures and later led me to tutor students
in the class, which is only allowed if the student receives an A in the class.
